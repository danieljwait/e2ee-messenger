# End-to-End Encrypted Instant Messenger
An end-to-end encrypted instant messaging program from which users log into their account, select a contact and then send/receive messages securely encrypted using RSA.

The program was created as coursework for A Level Computer Science so is not intended for use. The grade this coursework received was 69/70.

The project is written in C# using the WPF UI framework with a custom object-orientated networking application protocol. For more details see the project's writeup.

## Writeup
The project's writeup document is [writeup.pdf](./Writeup/writeup.pdf) or [writeup.docx](./Writeup/writeup.docx). It can be viewed online through the [README.md](./Writeup/README.md) in the Writeup directory but for the intended formatting downloading the pdf or word document is strongly recommended.

The writeup is split into four sections:

### 1. Analysis
This is where I investigated the problem of secure messaging, studied existing applications and protocols, collected primary data on my customers' needs, and decided on the features I would include.

### 2. Design
Here I constructed the plan for my solution on both a high and low level by deciding on how the program would be used and how those features could be realised.

### 3. Implementation
This is the section where I documented the solution through the iterative development methodology I used. Each iteration contains a plan, code analysis, testing, and evaluation.

### 4. Evaluation
Here the entire program was tested and compared against the success criteria I set out at the beginning of the project. How the program could be maintained and developed in the future was then discussed.
