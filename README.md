## Writeup
The main project writeup document is [writeup.docx](./Writeup/writeup.docx) which is a Microsoft Word document. Since this is a binary file, you cannot view the changes for each commit. Therefore, a markdown file is created by [update_markdown.cmd](./Writeup/update_markdown.cmd) using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) which lacks some of the document's formatting but enables the text changes for each commit to be viewed. This file is [README.md](./Writeup/README.md) and is named such so that it is automatically displayed by GitHub when the writeup directory is viewed.
